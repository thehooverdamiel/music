D                           A
Construction zone outside my window
            G
I fell out of bed again
          D
I'm getting used to it
      D
But you wept you said 
                        A
I tasted like pain to you
                  G
I think that it's just a mood
                    D
But I hope it starts leaving soon
        G
Like I do
        Bm        A
Like I do, Like I do
        G
Like I do
        Bm        A
Like I do, like I do

D
So I left then too
            A
I slept in a parking lot
            G
Used to feel dangerous
              D
now it's just sad
            D
Stories you tell to them
          A
Memories of fallen men
              G
Ball steps and pirhouettes
              D
And "I hadn't met you yet"s
          G
It's not true
          Bm              A
It's not true, it's not true
          G
It's not true
          Bm              A
It's not true, it's not true

D
Me? I still don't know
                A
A broken down but faithful radio
              G
A dopplering, dropped slur from a car window
                D
the sun on the ground
  D
But you? I do 
                    A
Raised red flags and charm and all
                      G
I bet you taste like my manias
                        D
Bet I don't want to find out
    G
But I do
    Bm        A
But I do, but I do
    G
But I do
    Bm        A
But I do, but I do

  D
So I folded and
                A
I fell like an actor then
              G
Performing a narrative
          D
Dressing, undressing it
                D
Is this how it's always been?
                  A
Don't know what the problem is
          G
People abandoning
            D
You without cause
        D
And you think that I won't 
              A
lonely looking young and vulnerable
                      G
I bet you taste like my lowest lows
            D
Bet I don't ever want to know
      G
But I do
      Bm      A
But I do, but I do
      G
But I do
      D
But I do
