 
[Verse 1]
E
I ain’t got A kiss left to give ya,
      A
Cause you weren’t good to me.
     E
Well I ain’t got no news left to feed ya
      A
Cause you weren’t good to me
 
[Chorus]
    E                  F#m           E
Its cold, its dark, its deep and its wet
    F#m
You ain’t gonna make it,
   B                       E       E7
If you don’t let somone one in
B                         	       		   A
Darlin’, darlin’, darlin’, why don’t you sleep at night
B                     B  Bb  A
The colder the heart
               E
The warmer the gun
 
[Verse 2]
E
Shotgun Alynda bring me our eyes
    A
For I wish to see like you
E
You looking froze and weathered my dear
         A
And your lips and your cheeks are turning blue
 
[Chorus]
    E                  F#m           E
Its cold, its dark, its deep and its wet
    F#m
You ain’t gonna make it,
   B                       E
If you don’t let somone one in
B                                        A
Darlin’, darlin’, darlin’, why don’t you sleep at night
B                      B  Bb  A
The colder the heart 
               E
The warmer the gun
 
[E-A repeat for solo hooray] 
 
[Chorus]
    E                  F#m           E
Its cold, its dark, its deep and its wet
    F#m
You ain’t gonna make it,
   B                       E       E7
If you don’t let somone one in
B                         B        A#   A
Darlin’, darlin’, darlin’, why don’t you sleep at night
B                        B    A#  A
The colder the heart is,  oh oh oh oh
               E
The warmer the gun
 
[E-A repeat until you feel like stopping]
