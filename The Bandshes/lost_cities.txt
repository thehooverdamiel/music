Lost Cities Tab, by the Bandshes

C - C7 - F - G

C
Lost cities, what a pity all those years spent building 
Am
on a love so flimsy, so unreal 
C
Lost cities, what a pity all that time spent on nothing 
F                 G
the structures crumble as they yell 

C             C7
till death, till death, till death do we part 
Am 
till death, till death, till the death of this love 
F 
(ooh)
G
(ooh)

C             (C7)
Lost cities, what a pity adults with hearts of youth 
Am
the walls and windows echo with the truth 
C
Lost cities, what a pity the way a home can cry, 
F             G
hearing angry voices as their love dies 

C               C7
till death, till death, till death do we part 
Am
till death, till death, of a crumbling love 
F
(ooh)
G     C7
(oof)

F
destroy yourselves already, you’re halfway there, 
Fm 
the buildings are falling, but you’re still here 
C
don’t you see there’s no home 
G           Am
no home left for love here 

C
Lost cities, what a pity no one knows when it’s time
Am
to accept a lost love and say goodbye 
F               C       G
Till death, till death, till death do we part 
F               G           C
till death, till the death of a failing love
